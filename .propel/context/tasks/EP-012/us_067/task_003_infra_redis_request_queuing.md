# Task - TASK_003

## Requirement Reference

- User Story: US_067
- Story Location: .propel/context/tasks/EP-012/us_067/us_067.md
- Acceptance Criteria:
    - AC-4: **Given** the AI Gateway processes document parsing requests, **When** multiple requests arrive simultaneously, **Then** they are queued via Redis and processed with configurable concurrency limits.
- Edge Case:
    - Both primary and fallback providers unavailable: Queued jobs remain in queue with retry; after max retries exceeded, moved to dead-letter queue with "AI service unavailable" status.

## Task Overview

Implement Redis-based request queuing for document parsing requests flowing through the AI Gateway. When multiple document parsing requests arrive simultaneously, they are enqueued into Redis and processed by background workers with configurable concurrency limits. This prevents AI provider rate limit violations (AIR-O07) and enables asynchronous processing (TR-012, NFR-029) so that callers receive immediate 202 Accepted responses while parsing executes in the background.

The task implements the producer/consumer pattern using Upstash Redis: the AI Gateway enqueues parsing jobs, and a .NET `BackgroundService` worker dequeues and processes them with bounded concurrency. Dead-letter queue handling ensures failed jobs are captured for investigation. Queue depth monitoring provides operational visibility.

## Dependent Tasks

- task_001_be_ai_gateway_scaffold — Requires AI Gateway service infrastructure, AIRequest/AIResponse DTOs, and DI configuration.
- US_004 - Foundational - Requires Redis infrastructure (Upstash Redis connection).

## Impacted Components

- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Queue/DocumentParsingQueueProducer.cs` — Enqueue parsing requests to Redis
- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Queue/IDocumentParsingQueueProducer.cs` — Queue producer interface
- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Queue/DocumentParsingQueueConsumer.cs` — BackgroundService worker for dequeuing and processing
- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Queue/QueueMessage.cs` — Queue message schema DTO
- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Queue/DeadLetterHandler.cs` — Dead-letter queue handler for failed jobs
- **NEW** `Features/AIGateway/Configuration/QueueOptions.cs` — Queue configuration POCO
- **MODIFY** `Features/AIGateway/Services/AIGatewayService.cs` — Route DocumentParsing requests through queue producer
- **MODIFY** `Features/AIGateway/Extensions/AIGatewayServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` — Register queue services and hosted worker
- **MODIFY** `Server/appsettings.json` — Add Queue configuration section

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define queue message schema** (`QueueMessage`):
   - `JobId` (Guid) — Unique job identifier for tracking
   - `DocumentId` (Guid) — Reference to ClinicalDocument entity
   - `Request` (AIRequest) — The AI Gateway request payload
   - `Priority` (enum: Normal, Urgent) — Processing priority
   - `EnqueuedAt` (DateTimeOffset) — Timestamp for latency tracking
   - `RetryCount` (int) — Current retry attempt (0-based)
   - `MaxRetries` (int) — Maximum retry attempts before dead-letter (default: 3)
   - `CorrelationId` (string) — Request tracing correlation

2. **Implement Redis queue producer** (`DocumentParsingQueueProducer : IDocumentParsingQueueProducer`):
   - Use `StackExchange.Redis` `IDatabase.ListRightPushAsync` to enqueue serialized `QueueMessage` to `ai-gateway:document-parsing:queue` key
   - Serialize messages using `System.Text.Json` with camelCase naming policy
   - Assign `JobId` and `EnqueuedAt` at enqueue time
   - Return `JobId` to caller for status tracking
   - Log enqueue event with CorrelationId, DocumentId, QueueDepth

3. **Implement Redis queue consumer** (`DocumentParsingQueueConsumer : BackgroundService`):
   - Override `ExecuteAsync` with `SemaphoreSlim` for configurable concurrency (default: 3 concurrent workers)
   - Use `IDatabase.ListLeftPopAsync` to dequeue from `ai-gateway:document-parsing:queue`
   - Deserialize `QueueMessage` and invoke `IAIGatewayService.SendCompletionAsync` for processing
   - On success: log completion with latency (now - EnqueuedAt)
   - On failure: increment `RetryCount`, re-enqueue if under `MaxRetries`, otherwise route to dead-letter queue
   - Implement polling with configurable interval (default: 500ms) to avoid busy-wait

4. **Implement dead-letter queue handling** (`DeadLetterHandler`):
   - Push failed messages to `ai-gateway:document-parsing:dead-letter` Redis key
   - Enrich with failure reason, last error message, failed timestamp
   - Log dead-letter event as Warning with full job context
   - Expose dead-letter queue depth in health monitoring metrics

5. **Add configurable concurrency and queue settings** via `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "AIGateway": {
       "Queue": {
         "QueueKey": "ai-gateway:document-parsing:queue",
         "DeadLetterKey": "ai-gateway:document-parsing:dead-letter",
         "MaxConcurrentWorkers": 3,
         "MaxQueueDepth": 100,
         "PollingIntervalMs": 500,
         "MaxRetries": 3,
         "DefaultPriority": "Normal"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Add queue depth monitoring and structured logging**:
   - Periodically log queue depth (every 30s) using Serilog structured properties
   - Log consumer throughput: jobs processed/minute, average processing time
   - Log queue saturation warnings when depth exceeds 80% of `MaxQueueDepth`
   - Include CorrelationId in all queue-related log entries for tracing

7. **Implement graceful shutdown**:
   - Override `StopAsync` in `DocumentParsingQueueConsumer`
   - Use `CancellationToken` to signal workers to complete current job
   - Wait for all in-flight jobs to complete (bounded by timeout: 30s)
   - Log remaining queue depth and in-flight count at shutdown
